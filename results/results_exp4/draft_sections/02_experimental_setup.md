## Experimental Setup (Draft)
- Matrix prefix: `exp4_matrix_20260215_151709`
- Suites: 8 (`2 datasets x 2 models x 2 failure schedules`)
- Datasets: `cifar10`, `cifar100`
- Models: `resnet18`, `resnet50`
- Failure schedules: `base(400,1200)`, `late(800,1400)`
- Checkpoint config: `every=50`, `max_inflight=4`
- Distributed config: `nproc=4`
- Seeds: `1` (`PROFILE=small`)
- Comparison groups per suite:
  - Reference: no injected failure
  - Failure+blocking: injected failures with blocking checkpoint strategy
  - Failure+overlapped: injected failures with overlapped checkpoint strategy
- Primary metrics:
  - Correctness pass rate
  - Goodput (`steps/sec`) and relative deltas
  - Restart count and replayed steps
  - Checkpoint stall/write/snapshot times
  - Divergence from reference checkpoints and losses
